Project Details
Business Process Management course for the 2024/2025 academic year

This project involves:

Modeling the current (AS-IS) state of the O2C process using BPMN.
Delivering a Bizagi file that outlines the process.
Company Background
Fims, established in 1998, is a well-known retailer in Portugal with a network of stores in cities like Lisbon, Porto, Faro, and Coimbra. The company also operates call centers in these cities, facilitating ticket sales. This project aims to model the O2C process to identify inefficiencies and improve customer satisfaction.

Key Objectives:
Understand and analyze the current O2C process in the Lisbon store and call center.
Model the AS-IS process in BPMN, highlighting steps, actors, and potential inefficiencies.
Deliver a Bizagi file detailing the entire O2C process, covering ticket sales via both physical and call center channels.
Project Scope
Process Details:
Order (tickets) registered at stores:

Customers can purchase tickets directly from stores in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, and Coimbra. Some may need to register, taking additional time.
On average, 100 tickets are purchased daily at the Lisbon store.
Order (tickets) registered by phone:

Customers can also purchase tickets through the call center in Lisbon, which processes around 110 daily ticket purchases.
Tickets can be delivered by email, post, or collected in-store.
Ticket Delivery:

Tickets purchased are either collected in-store, sent by email, or delivered by post, with varying timeframes.
Process Issues Identified
Customer Dissatisfaction due to inefficient processes and delays in ticket delivery.
Operational Inefficiencies due to limited staff, delays in registration and payment verification, and busy call centers.
BPMN Modeling
This project includes a detailed BPMN process model capturing the current O2C process. This model will aid in identifying bottlenecks and potential areas for improvement.
